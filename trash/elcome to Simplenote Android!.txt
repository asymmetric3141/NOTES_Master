Use tags to help organize your notes. Create a tag in the "Add tagâ€¦" field at the bottom of a note. You can also add an email address as a tag to share a note with someone.

Easily share notes with other Android apps by tapping "Share" in the "More Options" menu while viewing a note.

Deleted notes go in the trash. You can restore them if you want, or empty the trash to get rid of them forever.
