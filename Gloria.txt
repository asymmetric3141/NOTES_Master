Text: James 1:17 “Every Good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.”
	
	
	
	
	
	
I felt a sadness, a heavy heart, surrounded by vanity, so small, so futile, so beholden to so many and so much.  The text I was reading: 

(Deuteronomy 6:4) “Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD” The word LORD here is the word “Yahweh” or “Jehovah” meaning the “Self-existent and eternal One.”
 	
put a heavy mood on me.  I'm so fragile, so needy for each breath, each heartbeat.  Feeling I need to bow down and pray.  On my knees.  



	
"Think positive Jason"	~the spirit

I could sense that this was God being sarcastic.  There is little merrit to 'thinking positive' when it comes to many deep places in our hearts.  Total surrender in the presence of the Almighty God is the one and only good satisfaction, solution, comfort.  It often comes with bitterness, sadness, meloncholy, despair, longing, suffering of all kinds.  Yet, there is a place of satisfaction in it, that does not dissappoint, so long as one stays with it.  It's like listening to the full story, not walking away when the tension arrives.  There will be a resolution, in time, but our world so often omits that part.  It's all instant gratification.
