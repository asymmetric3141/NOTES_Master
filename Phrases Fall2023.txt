#[preposition's meaning in phrasal verbs]{Time is up, up = expired, down = short(not enough)}
#[pass-through,passthrough, and pass through]
{https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/125268/which-is-correct-pass-through-or-passthrough-or-pass-through
You found all three on Google because all three are acceptable depending on circumstances.

As a guideline -

use pass-through where it is an adjective before a noun (or sometimes an object-verbal noun compound such as egg-beater): They inspected the pass-through residue in the sediment trap.

use passthrough as a noun, unless this makes it too long and cumbersome: He found a passthrough in the wall.

Pass through is two words: I saw him pass through a closed door.

The principle is to maximise clarity. A man eating shark and a man-eating shark are two very different things, but a Sunday morning service and a Sunday-morning service are not so you could leave out the hyphen in the latter.}

No horse need go lame as a result of being unshod, but many horses will go lame as a result of being badly shod.
