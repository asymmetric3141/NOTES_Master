You found all three on Google because all three are acceptable depending on circumstances.

As a guideline -

use pass-through where it is an adjective before a noun (or sometimes an object-verbal noun compound such as egg-beater): They inspected the pass-through residue in the sediment trap.

use passthrough as a noun, unless this makes it too long and cumbersome: He found a passthrough in the wall.

Pass through is two words: I saw him pass through a closed door.
